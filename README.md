# RocketCogs

This repository is for Rocket-League related cogs for [RedBot V3](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot), which is a bot using the latest version of discord.py.


# About the cogs

## la_fusee

La Fus√©e (French for "The Rocket") is the project name for the cog that contains various commands related to Rocket League user stats. The cog's core functions are similar to RankCog and SetProfile cogs (both on V2 of RedBot), used on the Rocket League Coaching Discord. However, it is rewritten from scratch, and unified in order to make additional features possible.

This cog allows users to check their ranks (or those of others), by either specifying someone's platform and ID. Additionally, users can register their gamer ID (Steam, PlayStation 4, or Xbox), and use that to get their Rocket League stats.

#### Stat checking
Various ways of displaying one's stats are planned. As the cog is currently in development, only one of them is ready thus far.

- **lfg** - This command displays a player's current rank (tier, division, and rating) in each playlist using a compact embed. This embed is split in two views; one view for the "normal" playlists, and one for the "special" playlists such as Rumble. A user can switch between these two views by reactions added beneath the embed.

Other planned commands include:

- **stats [playlist]** - if no playlist is provided, display someone's ranking performance, as well as general online stats (goals, assists, etc). If a playlist is provided, it displays more specific stats of the player in that playlist, such as their amount of matches played.

- *more to follow*


#### Rank roles
In addition to the account registration, this cog has a built-in rank role feature. This feature allows a guild to automatically assign a rank role to its members when they register their account. For this, the guild staff can either manually create the roles, and make the bot automatically detect them, or let the bot make the roles needed for them.
The rank role functionality is optional, and is turned off by default.
