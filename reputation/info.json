  "description": "This cog allows members to give other members reputation. This reputation will then be stored in a database. Based on the database, further things can be done. For example, a leaderboard for the people with the most reps can be shown, people can look up their own reputation, and people that have a sufficient amount of reputation and have recently received reputation could also obtain a role (configurable).",
